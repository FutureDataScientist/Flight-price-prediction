    "The four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation: It is a mechanism that bundles data and methods (functions that operate on the data) together within a single unit, preventing unauthorized access to the data and protecting it from unintended modifications. It helps in achieving data hiding and abstraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance: It is a mechanism that enables a new class to be based on an existing class, inheriting its properties (attributes and methods) and reusing the code. The existing class is called the parent class or superclass, and the new class is called the child class or subclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism: It is the ability of an object to take on multiple forms or behaviors depending on the context. Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as if they were of the same class, providing a more flexible and extensible code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction: It is the process of hiding the implementation details of a class or a method and exposing only the essential features to the user. Abstraction allows the user to focus on what the object does rather than how it does it, making the code more user-friendly and easier to maintain."
