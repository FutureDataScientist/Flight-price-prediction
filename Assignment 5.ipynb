    "    Python is a general-purpose programming language that supports multiple programming paradigms, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "Procedural Programming: Python supports procedural programming, which involves breaking a program down into smaller, more manageable pieces called functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Python also supports object-oriented programming (OOP), which involves organizing a program around objects and data, rather than functions and logic.\n",

    "Functional Programming: Python supports functional programming, which involves using functions to perform tasks and avoiding changing state and mutable data.\n",

    "For example, the variable names \"myVariable\" and \"myvariable\" would be considered two different variables in Python, and attempting to use one where the other is expected would result in an error.\n",
