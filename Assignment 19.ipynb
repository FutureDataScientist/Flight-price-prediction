    "The GET and POST methods are two of the most commonly used HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) methods for sending data over the internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "GET:\n",
    "The GET method is used to retrieve data from a server. When a user sends a request to a server using the GET method, the server responds by sending back the requested data in the form of a webpage or other resource. The data that is sent using the GET method is appended to the URL in the form of query parameters. For example, if a user searches for \"pizza\" on a website, the URL might look like this: https://www.example.com/search?q=pizza. The GET method is ideal for retrieving information that is already available on the server, such as web pages or images.\n",
    "\n",
    "POST:\n",
    "The POST method is used to send data to a server. When a user submits a form or sends data using the POST method, the data is sent in the body of the request rather than being appended to the URL. This makes it more secure and allows for larger amounts of data to be sent. The data can be in any format, including text, images, or binary data. The server can then process the data and respond accordingly. The POST method is ideal for submitting information to a server, such as when a user fills out a form or uploads a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the GET method is used to retrieve data from a server, while the POST method is used to send data to a server. Both methods are important for communication between clients and servers on the internet."

    "Handling user input: The request object allows Flask to handle user input, such as form submissions or query parameters, and use that input to dynamically generate content for the user.\n",
